This study aims to quantify the value of in-game behavior in Kabaddi, a major sport centered in South Asia. A Kabaddi match is constructed through its fundamental rules and court, and the accumulation of points generated by the players. The outcome of a match includes not only the win or loss but also detailed information about how each player performed. By quantifying and analyzing this information, it may serve various purposes such as improving player and team performance, and strategizing. Future research will explore how to utilize this information to contribute to enhancing the competitiveness of Kabaddi.
